### Minor Changes

- 1be6b76: A card dispute has somewhere to land: `payment_disputes` in finance, bound to
  the payment session it contests and reachable from the booking.

  There was no card-dispute model. The `disputed` value that existed is a
  **supplier-invoice** status — an accounts-payable state for a bill the operator
  is contesting — and is unrelated to a customer charging back a payment. So when a
  traveller disputed a card payment the runtime had nowhere to record it: the
  booking kept reading as paid, the money was gone or frozen, and the only trace
  lived in whatever processor console the operator happened to check.

  A chargeback is a generic commerce event, not a property of any one processor.
  Every card processor produces them with the same shape, so the record belongs in
  the framework and nothing in it names a processor — `provider`,
  `processor_reference` and `reason_code` are opaque strings stored and handed back
  verbatim.

  **The model.** `payment_disputes` carries the contested amount and currency
  (which may be partial), the lifecycle status, `opened_at` and the processor's
  `respond_by` deadline where it supplies one, an opaque processor reference,
  `resolved_at`, and `evidence_submitted_at`. `PaymentDisputeStatus` is the
  framework's vocabulary — `opened`, `under_review`, `won`, `lost`, `withdrawn` —
  and an adapter maps its own stage names onto it. The last three are terminal and
  each names the resolution; there is no separate outcome column, because one
  could only ever disagree with the status.

  **Terminal is absorbing.** A processor that contests a payment again issues a new
  dispute rather than reviving a resolved one, so a replayed or out-of-order
  callback can never walk a resolution backwards. The ingest path tolerates such a
  report rather than failing — a webhook that 500s is retried forever — while the
  deliberate `PATCH` rejects an illegal transition with `409`.

  **A second dispute does not overwrite the first.** The record is idempotent on
  `(payment_session_id, processor_reference)`: a repeat report advances the dispute
  it already made, a different reference opens a second row. A hand-entered dispute
  with no reference always opens a new record, which is the safe default — two rows
  are recoverable, a silently overwritten dispute is not. The unresolved contested
  total is capped at the payment it contests.

  **The booking can tell the truth.** `GET /v1/admin/finance/bookings/{bookingId}/disputes`
  answers what payments and sessions cannot: a contested payment still reads
  `paid`, so `hasOpenDispute`, the per-currency contested total, and the soonest
  `respondBy` are how a caller distinguishes a cleanly paid booking from one whose
  money is being taken back. Plus `GET`/`POST /v1/admin/finance/payment-disputes`
  and `GET`/`PATCH .../{id}`.

  **The callback contract can deliver one.** `PaymentCallbackEvent` gains an
  optional `dispute` alongside `nextState` rather than inside it: a chargeback does
  not move the payment's own lifecycle — the session stays `paid`, which is exactly
  the problem — so the event reports the session's current state and puts what
  changed in `dispute`. The conformance kit validates the signal's shape and folds
  it into the duplicate-callback identity, so an adapter cannot vary a dispute
  across a replay.

  **An agent can record one too.** `record_payment_dispute` fronts the dispute
  endpoints for an agent reconciling a processor console. It declares its
  `adminWrites` rather than leaning on the name match, because `/finance/payments`
  and `/finance/invoices/{id}/payments` share the trailing noun `payment` and the
  inference would have reported _recording a payment_ as covered by a Tool that
  only records a dispute against one.

  **The banner degrades, it does not crash.** `BookingDisputeBanner` renders on the
  booking detail page whether or not the host asked for it, so it reads the finance
  context through the new `useOptionalVoyantReactContext`: a host that has not
  mounted `VoyantFinanceProvider` gets no banner rather than a crashed page. Every
  other finance hook stays strict — they are the point of the screen they are on.

  **Deliberately not in scope.** Payouts acquire no model here — money moving from
  a processor to the operator's bank is not the booking ledger's concern. Evidence
  assembly and submission stay behind the adapter port, where they belong; the
  framework records only that evidence was submitted and when, without knowing what
  was in it.

### Patch Changes

- 8d62a7c: Republish every affected TypeScript package without broken declaration maps so the corrected artifact
  policy reaches npm instead of applying only to future incidental package releases.

### Minor Changes

- e57725d: Flatten frontend provider wiring around a shared `@voyant-travel/react` config provider so module react packages can share one app-level Voyant context.
