  - @voyant-travel/hono@0.134.5

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 3651ff7: Add fail-closed provider-conditional action availability. An unavailable action
  may name one-valued typed provider ports with explicit `all` or `any` semantics;
  the resolved graph keeps it provisional even for exactly selected provider declarations.
  Malformed, unknown, or ambiguous conditions fail graph validation, while
  missing or unselected providers keep the action out of Tool imports, MCP,
  action-ledger policy, and enumerable runtime lowering. The framework retains
  activation-only Tool loaders privately, instantiates the exact selected provider
  factory, runs the action owner's imported typed-port conformance kit, and only
  then creates a non-forgeable activated runtime view for composition, direct Tool
  registration, action-ledger lowering, and MCP discovery. MCP now accepts only a
  runtime whose object identity was minted by framework lowering, so a fabricated
  structural graph cannot expose a conditional Tool by claiming it is available.
  Framework lowering first takes a detached, deeply immutable metadata snapshot;
  raw and activated runtimes therefore cannot have actions, provider conditions,
  Tool/reference loaders, or provider selections rewritten after minting.
  The MCP graph adapter declares framework 0.64 as a required peer rather than a
  direct runtime dependency. This keeps the package contract explicit without
  introducing a direct framework → operator distribution → MCP → framework
  runtime dependency cycle.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- b07a0a3: Add an explicit handler-owned durable result protocol for existing-target Tool
  commands, including atomic package-owned operation intent preparation, exact
  admission, stable replay context, organization-bound approval continuity, and
  framework/runtime contract validation. Existing-target command payloads are
  restricted to immutable, acyclic JSON values so their runtime identity cannot
  diverge from canonical fingerprinting; that sanitized frozen value is the
  authoritative target, fingerprint, claim, and handler snapshot.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- bf548af: Make generated-child Tool creation retry-safe by binding each command to an
  explicit stable parent anchor, admitting the selected graph action in the
  handler, and atomically persisting the command claim, child row, and canonical
  child reference.
- a6460e2: Add explicit created-target action metadata and fail closed unless handler-owned
  Tools declare a durable command claim, replay, and canonical result-reference
  contract. Adopt the shared transaction-owning created-command executor for
  Bookings reservations, stop asking MCP callers to invent generated target IDs,
  and fail approval-bearing created commands closed until handler control
  propagation exists.
- 8a4f3cd: Add fail-closed graph availability and tested-durability metadata for execute Tool actions.
  Unavailable actions remain diagnosable in resolved graph metadata while their Tool runtime is
  excluded from action-ledger and MCP lowering. Reclassify Trips pricing as a write and keep it
  unavailable until its provider and persistence stages gain tested durable orchestration.

### Patch Changes

- Propagate isolated handler-owned action controls through Tool context and support
  transactionally validated approval-required created-target commands.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f0fa26: Make Hono the explicit sole server API runtime while moving package and
  deployment interfaces to role-based API vocabulary. Replace Hono-prefixed module,
  extension, bundle, lazy-route, and factory names with `Api*` names; move
  router-named domain runtime entry points to `./api-runtime`; and remove the old
  names without compatibility aliases.

### Patch Changes

  - @voyant-travel/hono@0.128.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b8cef4c: Carry stable capability identity, owner, version, aliases, deprecation, audience, deployment
  risk, input/output schemas, and MCP annotations through the Tool registry and standard MCP
  discovery. Graph bindings now check runtime metadata parity, while legacy invocation aliases
  remain callable and exact capability-version lookup fails closed for unsupported versions.
- db5adce: Fail closed before selected graph Tool dispatch by binding each capability to its action-ledger
  policy. Advertise invocation controls in discovery, enforce confirmation, target, idempotency,
  fingerprint, approval, and principal semantics, and record required-ledger execution outcomes.

  Keep the existing package-owned booking cancellation and invoice refund approval workflows as
  explicit handler-enforced policies so their domain-state fingerprints and atomic ledgers are not
  double-gated.

- c9b6144: Add graph-composed, module-owned Tools for navigation preferences and organization setup,
  including exact action policies and owner-scoped project configuration for MCP context wiring.

### Patch Changes

- cabf662: Add the provider-neutral, staff-only action-ledger Tool surface for audit
  entries, target timelines, approvals, delegations, and relay inspection. Add
  guarded approval request/decision Tools whose capability, risk, and policy are
  derived from selected graph actions and whose writes fail closed for missing,
  conditional, expired, misassigned, or no-longer-selected authority. Publish
  selected graph actions to package Tool context contributions. Reversal remains
  inspection-only until a provider-neutral runtime can execute and attest the
  underlying domain reversal command.
- 0979758: Preserve complete Zod input contracts through standard MCP discovery and invocation, keep
  structured output envelopes aligned with their advertised schemas, and reject requests whose
  authenticated actor or audience grant claims are missing.
- ff87f68: Add staff-only workflow-run Tools for typed run inspection, registered workflow
  triggering, and rerun/resume retries. Writes require strict explicit scopes,
  confirmation, approval, action-ledger recording, and a graph-selected
  self-hosted workflow provider. Pass selected provider roles to package Tool
  context contributions so management operations fail closed when deployment
  authority is absent. Trigger and retry use a worst-case critical risk because
  the runner port has no per-workflow side-effect descriptors. Cancellation
  remains unavailable until the
  provider-neutral runner port exposes a real cancellation capability.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 73ab096: Standardize first-party packages on package-owned deployment manifests, provider selection,
  access metadata, concrete event contracts, selected admin navigation, and published runtime
  references. Add Bookings Extras as an independently selected graph unit and remove the central
  admin navigation catalog.
  Link facets now distinguish entity `linkable` metadata from executable `definition` exports, and
  generated Node registries reject malformed definitions before service registration.
  Provider-owned required config and secrets now apply only when that provider is selected, so
  local and in-memory deployments do not require credentials for inactive remote providers.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 490d132: Expose the selected graph and runtime-port providers to package runtime factories, then make MCP compose its graph and tool context without Operator-specific wiring.
- 490d132: Compose MCP tools and their service context from graph-selected package runtime exports instead of an Operator-owned product catalog.
- 490d132: Move Commerce, Catalog, Finance, Legal, and Storage runtime authority out of the
  resident Node compatibility provider container. Compose selected routes through
  package graph factories and typed runtime ports, and resolve Catalog and Finance
  MCP services through package-owned tool-context contributions.

### Patch Changes

### Minor Changes

- 1655995: Publish the agent tool library (`@voyant-travel/tools`) and the in-deployment MCP
  server (`@voyant-travel/mcp`). `@voyant-travel/tools` is the transport-neutral,
  headless tool contract (`defineTool`, `createToolRegistry`, risk metadata);
  `@voyant-travel/mcp` exposes a tool registry as a Model Context Protocol server
  mounted at `/v1/admin/mcp`.
